                this is a very <strong>strong</strong>
                text, cause it is <strong>bold</strong><br>
                i would like to <em>emphasize</em> how
                important it is to follow this course
                until the end!<br>
                this is some <u>underlined</u> text.<br>
                I was often using any of the
                available “lorem ipsum” generators
                on the web while testing different
                things in LaTeX until I discovered
                that the Latex distribution provides
                packages generating blind text, which
                is definitely more convenient. With
                just a few lines of code, these
                packages will generate paragraphes,
                even whole documents with sections,
                paragraphs of text, lists, etc.
